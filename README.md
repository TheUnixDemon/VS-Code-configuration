# VS Code setup for development
This VS Code configuration I made is for setup my development enviroments. This include the languages within the web development(HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, TS and React), C++, Java, Python(3). 

For these languages are included extensions like debugger, autocomplete and my own created snippets.

## Installation
You can use the "loadData.sh" or the "TheUnixDaemon.code-profile" for the setup of VS Code.
