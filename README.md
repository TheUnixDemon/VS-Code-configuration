# VS Code setup for development
This VS Code configuration is made for an mobile setup of an development enviroment. This include the languages within the web development(HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, TS, React and NextJS), CPP, Java, Python(3), Docker and LaTeX. 

For these languages are included extensions like debugger, autocomplete and co. 

## Important towards Docker
I configured Docker on Podman. That's why there are problems with Docker. I strongly recommend not to use the profile image if you want to use Docker.

## Installation
You can use the "loadData.sh" or the "theunixdaemon.code-profile" for the setup of VS Code.
